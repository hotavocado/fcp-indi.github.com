			  QUALITY CONTROL PAGES

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:
— - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging has become a more widely used clinical tool in everyday practice for both research and clinical applications which makes it increasingly important to engage in quality control and quality assurance measures. C-PAC provides researchers and analysts the necessary tools for performing a complete Quality Control analysis through it’s Quality Control (QC) configuration. 


COMPUTATION AND ANALYSIS:
— - - - - - - - - - - - 
The QC pages provide multiple  parameters for assessing the quality of results of evaluation:
SNR values: Signal to Noise ratio 
Movement plots:
	Movement transition plots
	Head Displacement plots
 	Frame wise displacement plot
Histogram plots:
	Signal to noise ratio
	Seed based correlation analysis
	Network Centrality 
	Temporal Dual Regression 
	Regional Homogeneity (reho)
	Amplitude low-frequency fluctuations (alff)
	Fractional Amplitude low frequency fluctuations (f-alff)
Analysis and Visualization: 
	Visual result of skull strip
	Grey Matter, White matter & CSF
	MNI Edge overlapped on Mean functional Image
	T1 Edge overlapped on Mean functional Image
	MNI Edge overlapped on Normalized anatomical 
	seed based correlation analysis 
	Temporal dual regression 
	Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic connectivity
	Network Centrality

The analysis and visualization is presented as a montage taken using two planes: Axial and Sagittal.

APPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATION:

The QC pages are generated to display the parameters (referred above) for each subject run in a workflow. It is not a batch job and does not average the results for multiple subjects within a pipeline, instead it generates the results per subject in a workflow. 

It is always recommended to switch “on” [1] the Quality Control toggle as it is an efficient method to asses the quality of your image processing. 
Configuring C-PAC to generate Quality Control Images:

This can be easily performed using the GUI or manually changing the pipeline configuration (.yml) file. In the GUI, the Quality Control Images option is part of the “output settings” tab, and can be turned “On” or “Off”. 
If changing manually, you can add the following line on your pipeline configuration file:
	generateQualityControlImages: [1]

The results of your run will be stored in the output folder. C-PAC also provides a convenient HTML file with the qc folder (in the output directory) which provides a web interface for viewing the images. There is an index page that provides short links to the all the quality images generated.
